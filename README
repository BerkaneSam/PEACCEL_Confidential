fakedataset.csv is a fake dataset that was made with random mutation as well as fitness made up randomly with a random sequence (random_seq.fasta)

to check if the sequence corresponds to the dataset use seq_checker_V2.py, write in the cmd where the files and the scripts are:

python seq_checker_V2.py fakedataset.csv -f random_seq.fasta -aa 4 -pos 5 -j 1

	-h : help to use the script
	-f : the fasta sequence to use as reference
	-aa : the column where to find the original amino acid (first column = 0)
	-pos : column where to find the position in the sequence (first column = 0)
	-j : number of lines to be jumped in the file to reach actual data


to make new file with the mutated sequence use dataseq_melting.py, write in the cmd where the files and the scripts are:

python dataseq_melting.py fakedataset.csv -f random_seq.fasta -m 0

	-h : help to use the script
	-f : the fasta sequence to use as reference
	-m : column where to find the mutation in the right format (aaposaa)(first column = 0)

the output is a new csv file with the sequences

to make files needed for InnovSAR use Data_treatment.py, write in the cmd where the files and the scripts are:

python Data_treatment.py fakedataset_seq.csv -m 0 -f 1 -ff random_seq.fasta

	-h : help to use the script
	-ff : the fasta sequence to use as reference
	-m : column where to find mutation in csv file (first column = 0)
	-f : column where to find fitness in csv file (first column = 0)

to cut an xlsx file into multiple csv file (based on the sheets) use dataset_sep.py, write in the cmd where the files and the scripts are:

python dataset_sep.py dataset_to_be_used.xlsx

	dataset_to_be_used.xlsx : any xlsx file with multiple sheets

it will write n csv files with n being the number of sheets in the xlsx file, the openpyxl library must be installed to work
you may install with:
conda install openpyxl, if you have conda
pip install openpyxl
